# All Software has Issues

<span />

Code will always have issues
- e.g. bugs, things we want to add or improve


It's not enough to know about them, we need to <span v-mark.underline.orange="1">manage</span> them
- Identify, record, prioritise

# Testing

<div class="h-5" />

Humans are fallible! Our software will contain defects
  - In requirements, design, as well as code
  - 1-10-150 hours to fix in design/development/production
  - Microsoft Study estimated 10-20 defects per 1000 lines of code

<div class="h-5" />

<v-click>

**Validation**: are we building the right product?

**Verification**: are we building the product right?
  - Manual testing, automated testing, code reviews

# Repercussions of Software Bugs

## Basic science

::left::

<div class="h-5"></div>

- Highly-cited papers published on multidrug resistance transporters (2001 - 2010)
- Results couldn't be reproduced - 5 retractions
- Caused by error in an internal software utility
- Flipped two columns of data, inverting electron-density map used to derive protein structure

# Repercussions of Software Bugs

## Mars Climate Orbiter

::left::

<div class="h-5"></div>

In 1999 orbiter was lost in space due to a simple unit conversion error (mix-up between metric and imperial units) in its navigation software, costing NASA **$125 million**.
- Communication lost as it entered orbit
- Root cause was unit conversion error
- No proper "checks and tests" on the software responsible were conducted!

# Repercussions of Software Bugs

## Knight Capital

::left::

<div class="h-10"></div>

In 2012 a software glitch in the trading system of Knight Capital, one of the largest U.S. trading firms, led to a loss of **$440 million** in just 30 minutes.
- New code changes up until it went live
- Changes activated old test code
- Old code on single server produced thousands of incorrect stock purchase orders very rapidly

# The Role of Automation in Software Testing

<div class="h-5" />

Manual testing _is_ necessary.

<v-click>

However...
- Prone to error
- Can be time-consuming, expensive

</v-click>

<v-click>

Automated testing involves writing code to test software
- Computers are great at repetitive tasks!
- Define complex, repeatable processes with fewer errors
- Saves effort in the long run

</v-click>

<v-click>

Automated testing should **supplement**, but not **replace**, all manual testing

</v-click>

---

# Automated Testing

<span />

**Unit tests**: Test specific units of functionality, ensuring expected outputs from given inputs.

<v-click>

```python
def celsius_to_fahrenheit(celsius):
    return 32 + 1.8 * celsius

celsius_to_fahrenheit(1.0)
> 33.8

celsius_to_fahrenheit(12.34)
> 54.212
```

</v-click>

<v-click at="2">
<div>

```python {none|all|none}
def test_celsius_to_fahrenheit():
    assert celsius_to_fahrenheit(1.0) == 33.8
    assert celsius_to_fahrenheit(12.34) == 54.212
```

</div>
</v-click>

<v-click at="3">

```python
import numpy as np

def test_celsius_to_fahrenheit():
    assert np.isclose(celsius_to_fahrenheit(1.0), 33.8)
    assert np.isclose(celsius_to_fahrenheit(12.34), 54.212)
```

# PyTest

<span />

**pytest**: a framework for automated testing

<v-click>

- Automatically finds any function starting in `test_` or ends in `_test`
- Produces a report indicating test status
- Many advanced features (e.g. exception testing, mocks, fixtures)
- Install with `pip install pytest`
- Run with `pytest` (or `pytest -v` for an itemised view)

</v-click>

<v-click>

Testing investment should match the software's complexity and usage

</v-click>

<!--
Rather than managing tests manually, PyTest provides a convenient package to collate
and run tests across a codebase, producing a reports with their status.

# Unit testing

::left::

::center
Write some unit tests
::

::right::

- Instructor: demo pytest install and running the test suite
- Write tests for the `smoothie` function in the file `smoothie.py` (tip: read the docstring and try out the function to see how it behaves)
- Run the test suite
- Write a test that fails (to see the output)
- Think of edge cases that can be added to the test suite (e.g. empty ingredients list?)

Want more practice? Check out `utils.py` and `test_utils.py`.
